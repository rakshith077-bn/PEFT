# Contributing to PEFT

I appreciate your interest in contributing to `PEFT`!. I aim to come up with a better name for this soon enough. This document highlights the guidelines for contributing to the project. 

## Getting Started

Before making a contribution, please ensure you have read and understood the following:
- **README.md**: This file outlines instructions for getting started with the model. Ensure you get the model running on your local system and run the `finetune.py` and `feature_extraction.py` with `sample_data`. 

**NOTE**: The `sample_data` now contains a decent amount of images, that can be used to check the running condition of the model on your system.

- The model isn't suited to a specific type of images, but if you do encounter any problems with your dataset, open a clearly stated issue. 
- If you are using multiple image dataset, and find the it  works better on a specific type of dataset, write a new file named 'datasets.md' within this directory and describe the nature of datasets used and the performance comparision appropriately.
