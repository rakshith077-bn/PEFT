# Contributing to PEFT

I appreciate your interest in contributing to `PEFT`!. I aim to come up with a better name for this soon enough. This document highlights the guidelines for contributing to the project. 

## Getting Started

Before making a contribution, please ensure you have read and understood the following:
- **README.md**: This file outlines instructions for getting started with the model. Ensure you get the model running on your local system and run the `finetune.py` and `feature_extraction.py` with `sample_data`. 

**NOTE**: The `sample_data` contains very limited images which will not yield potential results that are comparable.

- You are encouraged to test the model with an image dataset of your own. The guidelines for selecting the image datasets have not been laid out yet, if you feel like this model showcases better performance for a specific type of image datasets, ensure to include a clear and detailed description of the dataset used in a separate file when contributing.

2. Commit your changes. Follow a simple and a concise description.
